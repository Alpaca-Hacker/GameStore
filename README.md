Game Store
====

An example of a responsive E-commerce website designed to help master the ASP.NET MVC 5 framework.

A SQL database holds details of the products, including the name, type, cost and image and these are displayed on the product page.
The products can be sorted by type, which is automatically generated on the left hand panel.

A cart and checkout system is in place in order to buy the items. Currently this only emails the administrator with the order details, but could easily be expanded.

Also includes an administration area to create, update and delete products.

Unit tests cover all major areas of the project.

Uses Ninject as a IoC and Moq to help with the testing.
